# CS428-Project1
Repository for Project 1 for CS 428 Virtual and Augmented Reality

# How to Install & Run
1. Make sure you have Unity 2019.2.x installed. 
	*(I ran it with 2019.2.3f1)*
2. Clone this repository (through git). The repo should be about 1GB (if it's not, there's something wrong.)
	*(If you clone directly from GitHub, some files will cause errors since they're not fully installed.)*
	*ie. GitHub, limits the amount of file size it can download when it downloads*
3. Open from Unity Hub with windows 64 configurations (not ios)
4. Navigate to the "Assets/Scenes" folder.
5. Open the scene "Main" and click play.
	* *You may need to change the AR camera to your own video device.*
6. Use "front.jpg" and "back.jpg" image targets.
	* These are already included in the root of this repository, but, if you need to download them here they are:
		* <a href="front.jpg" download>Front.jpg</a>
		* <a href="back.jpg" download>Back.jpg</a>
		* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSzqMmAMNnY">Review Video</a>
		* *use review link if local video not working. (Just drag missing video URL to video object in inspector)*
